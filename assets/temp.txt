Create a sleek, wide-format GitHub README banner for a project called 'ImageFusion'. It should show a tech-themed, modern design with abstract image blending elements, AI-inspired visuals (like neural network lines or image fusion effects), and text that reads: 'ImageFusion â€“ AI-powered Multi-Image Generator'. Background should be dark-themed or gradient, with subtle icons for FastAPI, React, and OpenAI.
